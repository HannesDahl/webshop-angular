# Webshop Angular Backend
Server made with express and database with sqlite3/dbbrowser.
## Run server

Run server with `npm run dev`, this uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to still have it running when changing something in the server.

Or use `npm run start` if you dont have nodemon installed.
